## üèóÔ∏è **STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Scripts Directory Cleanup**
Current scripts:
```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-blog-index.mjs        # No blog functionality exists
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-complete-sitemap.mjs  # Duplicate of build-sitemap-fixed.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-sitemap-fixed.mjs     # Keep - actively used
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-seo-assets.mjs     # Keep - SEO generation
```
**Action:** Delete blog and duplicate sitemap scripts

### **2. Component Organization**
```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ premium/              # Premium component library (50+ components)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Extensive but barely used
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/           # Clean structure ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/             # Clean structure ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [individual components] # Well organized ‚úÖ
```
**Note:** Premium components are sophisticated but underutilized

### **3. Data Structure**
```
src/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contentMaster.ts      # Empty template - DELETE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ millstoneIndia.ts     # Industrial data - Archive or DELETE
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vedicWisdomSeries.ts  # Active spiritual data ‚úÖ
```

const KnowledgeCenterPage = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/KnowledgeCenterPage'))
```

### **3. Environment Configuration Update**
**.env.production** still references BOB Institute:

```
