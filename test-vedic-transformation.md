### Tips for Using Playwright MCP

1. **Always start with navigation**: `@playwright-browser navigate "url"`
2. **Use text selectors**: `click "text=Button Text"` is more reliable
3. **Take screenshots**: Document each step of transformation
4. **Check console errors**: `@playwright-browser get_console_messages`
5. **Verify content**: Use `get_page_content` to ensure text is correct

### Next Steps

1. Start local dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Begin testing current Millstone India site
3. Make configuration changes
4. Test each transformation step
5. Document with screenshots
